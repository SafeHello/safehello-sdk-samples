                        Software Development Kit Agreement
                                   January 2022

This is the SafeHello* Software Development Kit Agreement. The SafeHello
software development kit (the "SDK") includes the SafeHello system files,
documentation, software code, and other materials made available to you.
The SDK is licensed to you subject to the terms of this Agreement. This
Agreement forms a legally binding contract between you and SafeHello in
relation to your use of the SDK.

1. Accepting this Agreement
   a. By using the SDK (or any portion), you hereby agree to the terms
      and conditions of this Agreement.
   b. You may not use the SDK if you do not accept this Agreement.
   c. You may not use the SDK and may not accept the Agreement if you are
      a person barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United
      States or other countries including the country in which you are
      resident or from which you use the SDK.
   d. If you are agreeing to be bound by this Agreement on behalf of your
      employer or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have
      full legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to this
      Agreement. If you do not have the requisite authority, you may not
      accept the Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your employer or
      other entity.

2. SDK License from SafeHello
   a. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, SafeHello grants you a limited,
      personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive,
      nontransferable and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK solely to
      develop transactions for the SafeHello platform.
   b. You may not use this SDK to develop another SDK.
   c. You agree that SafeHello or third parties own all legal right, title
      and interest in and to the SDK, including any Intellectual Property
      Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual Property Rights" means any
      and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
      trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights now existing or
      which may come into existence in the future on a worldwide basis.
      SafeHello reserves all rights not expressly granted to you.
   d. You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by this
      Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party
      licenses, you may notcopy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt,
      redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or create
      derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.
   e. Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed
      under an open source software license are governed solely by the terms
      of that open source software license and not this Agreement.
   f. You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that SafeHello provides
      may change with 30 days prior notice to you and that future versions
      of the SDK may be incompatible with applications developed on previous
      versions of the SDK. You agree that SafeHello may stop (permanently or
      temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you
      or to users generally at SafeHello's sole discretion, without prior
      notice to you.
   g. Nothing in this Agreement grants you a right to use any of SafeHello's
      trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other
      distinctive brand features.
   h. You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary
      rights notices (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be
      affixed to or contained within the SDK.

3. Use of the SDK by You
   a. SafeHello agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you
      (or your licensors) under this Agreement in or to any software
      applications that you develop using the SDK, including any intellectual
      property rights that subsist in those applications.
   b. You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that
      are permitted by (a) this Agreement and (b) any applicable law,
      regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant
      jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or
      software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
   c. You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general
      public users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of those
      users. If your application stores personal or sensitive information
      provided by users, it must do so securely.
   d. You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK,
      including the development or distribution of an application, that
      interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in an unauthorized
      manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of any
      third party including, but not limited to, SafeHello or any mobile
      communications carrier.
   e. You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that SafeHello has no
      responsibility to you or to any third party for) any data, content, or
      resources that you create, transmit or display through any applications
      created using the SDK, and for the consequences of your actions
      (including any loss or damage which SafeHello may suffer) by doing so.
   f. You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that SafeHello has no
      responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your
      obligations under this Agreement, any applicable third-party contract or
      Terms of Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the
      consequences (including any loss or damage which SafeHello or any third
      party may suffer) of any such breach.

4. Your Developer Credentials
   a. You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of
      any developer credentials that may be issued to you by SafeHello or which
      you may choose yourself and that you will be solely responsible for all
      applications that are developed under your developer credentials.

5. Information Use
   a. In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, SafeHello may collect
      certain usage statistics from the software including but not limited to a
      unique identifier, associated IP address, version number of the software,
      and information on which tools and/or services in the SDK are being used
      and how they are being used.
   b. Any personal information that might be collected is examined in the aggregate to
      improve the SDK and is maintained in accordance with SafeHello's Privacy Policy.

6. Third Party Applications
   a. If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that
      access data, content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that
      SafeHello is not responsible for those applications, data, content, or
      resources. You understand that all data, content or resources which you may
      access through such third party applications are the sole responsibility of
      the person from which they originated and that SafeHello is not liable for 
      any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access
      of any of those third party applications, data, content, or resources.
   b. You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through
      such a third party application may be protected by intellectual property
      rights which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on
      their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or
      create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources (either
      in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
      do so by the relevant owners.
   c. You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content,
      or resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant
      third party. In that case, this Agreement does not affect your legal
      relationship with these third parties.

7. Using SafeHello APIs
   a. If you use any API to retrieve data from SafeHello, you acknowledge that the
      data may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
      SafeHello or those parties that provide the data (or by other persons or
      companies on their behalf). Your use of any such API may be subject to
      additional terms of service or terms of use. You may not modify, rent, lease,
      loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either
      in whole or in part) unless allowed by the relevant terms of service or
      terms of use.
   b. If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from SafeHello, you acknowledge
      and agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent
      and only when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given
      you permission to do so.

8. Term and Terminating this Agreement
   a. This Agreement will be in force and effect from the date of commencement of
      this Agreement (being the earlier of the date of your acceptance of this
      Agreement or first use of any portion of the SDK) until terminated by either
      party at any time. Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, all of
      your rights to use the SDK expire automatically, provided that any obligations
      and liabilities that explicitly or necessarily must survive such termination
      shall continue to apply.

9. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES
   a. YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL
      DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE
      RISK AND THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY

      AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.

11. Indemnification
   a. To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold

13. General Terms
   a. This Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and SafeHello and
      governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which SafeHello may provide to
      you under a separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior
      agreements between you and SafeHello in relation to the SDK.
   b. You agree that if SafeHello does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy
      which is contained in this Agreement (or which SafeHello has the benefit of under
      any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of SafeHello's
      rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to SafeHello.
   c. If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that
      any provision of this Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed
      from this Agreement without affecting the rest of this Agreement. The remaining
      provisions of this Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.
   d. You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which
      SafeHello is the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to this Agreement and
      that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon,
      any provision of this Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of)
      them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be third party
      beneficiaries to this Agreement.
   e. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
      YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT

      transferred by you without the prior written approval of SafeHello, which may be
      withheld for any reason.
   g. This Agreement, and your relationship with SafeHello under this Agreement, shall be
      governed by the laws of the state of Texas without regard to its conflict of laws
      provisions, and the applicable federal laws therein. You and SafeHello agree to
      submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Travis County, Texas
      to resolve any legal matter arising from this Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you
      agree that SafeHello shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an
      equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.
